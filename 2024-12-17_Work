Vite Configuration

Updated vite.config.js to integrate Laravel and React:
javascript
Copy code
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/js/app.jsx'],
            refresh: true,
        }),
        react(),
    ],
});
React Setup

Updated resources/js/app.jsx to include React root render:
javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
);
Routing Configuration

Created AppRouter.jsx under resources/js/routes to configure React Router:
javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from '../pages/Home';
import Destinations from '../pages/Destinations';
import Attractions from '../pages/Attractions';
import Activities from '../pages/Activities';
import Restaurants from '../pages/Restaurants';
import Accommodations from '../pages/Accommodations';
import Profile from '../pages/Profile';
import Wishlist from '../pages/Wishlist';
import NotFound from '../pages/NotFound';

export default function AppRouter() {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="/destinations" element={<Destinations />} />
                <Route path="/attractions" element={<Attractions />} />
                <Route path="/activities" element={<Activities />} />
                <Route path="/restaurants" element={<Restaurants />} />
                <Route path="/accommodations" element={<Accommodations />} />
                <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
                <Route path="/wishlist" element={<Wishlist />} />
                <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
            </Routes>
        </Router>
    );
}
Project Cleanup

Cleaned up Laravel's cache:
bash
Copy code
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
Git Setup and Conflict Resolution

Initialized Git and linked to the repository:
bash
Copy code
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/walidkuzi/TouristGuideApp.git
Added, committed, and attempted to push changes.
Resolved merge conflicts in .gitignore and README.md.
Rebasing was done successfully after fixing conflicts.
Finally, force-pushed the changes:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main --force
🚀 Current Status
React and Laravel are successfully integrated.
Project has a clean, organized structure.
Routing is set up with placeholder components.
Initial commit pushed to GitHub.
